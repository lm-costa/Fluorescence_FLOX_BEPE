# **First Statments**

This repository is part of a project financed by the [*SÃ£o Paulo state research support foundation (FAPESP)*](https://fapesp.br/en) under the process [2021/06477-0](https://bv.fapesp.br/en/bolsas/197773/evaluation-of-different-approaches-for-the-retrieval-of-sun-induced-fluorescence/)

The proposed method for Fluorescence Re-absorption Corrected (F-RC) is based on the Phd thesis from [Cesana, I.](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ilaria-Cesana), the thesis is not avaialable yet. 

More about whow the data was processed can be found in the folowings repositories: [Draft 1](https://github.com/lm-costa/draft_bepe) and [Draft 2](https://github.com/lm-costa/draft_2_bepe) 


# **Data**

The data consist in a time-series from 24th may from 14th july of 2018, and the measuremenst of the fluorescence was in an alfalfa crop in Grosseto Italy. More about the retrieval of the fluoresnce at Top Of Canopy can be found in [Cogliati et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs11161840) 

The folder `data` contains all processed data in two different sky conditions: **i)clear sky days**; **ii)partial clound days**. 

The data avaialable in the folders were retrieved by the codes `clear.R` and `partial.R`, founded in the `R` folder. the other codes avaialables in the folder are basicaly the same, however with some restrictions or a different aproach in some formulation, where, the condition of sky (clear or partial) folowing: 

i) SZA: the interval of the Solar Zenital Angle was set in the interval of 20 to 50 degress

ii) day: the analyses was made by just 2 days

iii) L750: For the Re-absorption correction the Ligth incoming at 750 nm was used instead of the cos(SZA) 

# **Model**

We applied two methods of modelling: 

i) Random Forest Analyses

ii) Stepwise regression


# **Figures**

All figures can be reproduced using the code `graphs.R`



# **Final Statment**

The data are avaialable for non commercial use.
