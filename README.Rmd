# **First Statments**

This repository is part of a project financed by the [*SÃ£o Paulo state research support foundation (FAPESP)*](https://fapesp.br/en) under the fundings: [2021/06477-0](https://bv.fapesp.br/en/bolsas/197773/evaluation-of-different-approaches-for-the-retrieval-of-sun-induced-fluorescence/) and [2019/25812-4](https://bv.fapesp.br/en/bolsas/190947/spatial-and-temporal-variability-of-atmospheric-co2-in-the-metropolitan-region-of-ribeirao-preto-sao/)

The proposed method for Fluorescence Re-absorption Corrected (F-RC) is based on the Phd thesis from [Cesana, I.](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ilaria-Cesana), the thesis is not avaialable yet.


# **Data**

## **Fluorescence Full - Spectrum at Top Of Canopy (TOC)**

The data consist in a time-series from 24th may from 14th july of 2018, and the measurements of the fluorescence was in an alfalfa crop in Grosseto Italy. More about the retrieval of the fluorescence at TOC can be found in [Cogliati et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs11161840). 

After the measuarments and fitting F full-spectra by the method described [Cogliati et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs11161840), the dataset was processed in the R programming language, for more informations about the proceding can be found at in the followings repositories: [Draft 1](https://github.com/lm-costa/draft_bepe) and [Draft 2](https://github.com/lm-costa/draft_2_bepe). However this repositories it is a first draft with explanations about the formulas used in the code. The finals codes are in this repository. 

The folder `data` contains all processed data in two different sky conditions: **i)clear sky days**; **ii)partial clound days**. The raw data, for applications of the full-script must be required to [Costa, L.M.](luism.costa00@gmail.com)

The data avaialable in the folders was retrieved by the codes `clear.R` and `partial.R`, founded in the `R` folder. the other codes availables in the folder are basically the same, however with some restrictions or a different approach in some formulation, where, the condition of sky (clear or partial) following: 

i) *SZA*: the interval of the Solar Zenital Angle was set in the interval of 20 to 50 degress

ii) *day*: the analyses was made by just 2 days

iii) *L750*: For the Re-absorption correction the Light incoming at 750 nm was used instead of the cos(SZA) 

## **GPP data**

The documatation about the GPP can be found in the folder `documatation`. For our analyses we just used the GPP_DT_U95. This means that we use the GPP measuments at day with 95% of urcertanti confidence.

# **Model**

We applied two methods of modelling: 

i) Random Forest Analyses

ii) Stepwise regression


# **Figures**

All figures can be reproduced using the code `graphs.R`, however, here are the example of the Pearson's correlation between GPP and The F full spectra:

```{r}
correl_partial <- readr::read_rds("data/partial/correl.rds")
correl_frc_partial <- readr::read_rds("data/partial/correl_frc.rds")

correl_partial[-c(683,684),] |>
  ggplot2::ggplot(ggplot2::aes(x=V4,y=correl,ymax=uper,ymin=lower))+
  ggplot2::geom_ribbon(alpha=.1,linetype="dashed",color="black")+
  ggplot2::geom_jitter(color="black")+
  ggplot2::geom_ribbon(ggplot2::aes(ymax=correl_frc_partial$uper[-c(683,684)],
                                    ymin=correl_frc_partial$lower[-c(683,684)]),
                       color='red', linetype='dashed',alpha=.1)+
  ggplot2::geom_point(ggplot2::aes(x=correl_frc_partial$V4[-c(683,684)],
                                    y=correl_frc_partial$correl_fr[-c(683,684)]),
                      color='red')+
  ggplot2::ylim(0,1)+
  ggplot2::labs(x=expression("Wavelenght ("~ lambda ~")"),
                y=expression('Correlation (GPP vs F('~lambda~'))' ))+
  ggplot2::theme(axis.title= ggplot2::element_text(size=16),
                 axis.text = ggplot2::element_text(size=14,color='black'))
```


# **Final Statment**

The data are avaialable for non commercial use.
